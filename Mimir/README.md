**Mimir** is a backend for [Tyr](https://github.com/MahjongPantheon/pantheon/tree/master/Tyr) (mobile assistant),
[Forseti](https://github.com/MahjongPantheon/pantheon/tree/master/Forseti) (user profile and administration service), and
[Sigrun](https://github.com/MahjongPantheon/pantheon/tree/master/Sigrun) (rating tables and visualizations).
Mimir provides storage of game information for japanese (riichi) mahjong sessions. 

### Features

We needed a simple but stateful API for gaming assistance in aspects like:
- Storing game log for an offline game.
- Automated scoring and game log sanity checking (for offline games).
- Fetching game logs from online mahjong services.
- Keeping players' gameplay history and make some interesting statistics for their games.
- Automating creating and performing of online and offline tournaments.
- And many more...

### Developer information

We accept any help with developing, testing and improving our system, so please feel free to create issues or send 
pull requests for missing functionality.

### Legend
