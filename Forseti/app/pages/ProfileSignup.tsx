                Hugin - sub-service of Pantheon - tracks and reports website traffic. All the
                collected data is anonymous, but it can be shared with developer crew to improve
                Pantheon service. All data is depersonalized, so the analytics service is considered
                GDPR-compliant.

                For a self-hosted Pantheon instance, the administrator may choose to disable
